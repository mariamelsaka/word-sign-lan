## 📷 Real-Time Arabic Sign Language Recognition (OpenCV Webcam + AI Model)

# 🎓 About the Project
This module uses OpenCV and MediaPipe to detect hand gestures in real time through a webcam and recognizes Arabic sign language characters by feeding the input into a pre-trained AI model trained on Kaggle data.

# 🚀 Features
- Real-time hand detection using MediaPipe
- CNN AI model based on ResNet architecture to recognize signs
- Webcam integration for interactive quizzes
- Instant feedback to users based on sign recognition


The program will show live video with hand detection and recognized signs on screen.

# 🎯 Role & Technologies
Uses OpenCV and MediaPipe for hand detection

TensorFlow model (ResNet) for sign classification

Provides the interactive quiz feature with camera input
